The purpose of this project is to apply coding skills to picking up low-level scripting skills in Git-Bash terminal using the text editor nano.

- I did not add the cal command in the task.sh because cal command does not work.
- Used nano instead of vi for all of my shell files.
- Simple Backup Bash Shell Script:
	- I was able to do the simple ls command to backup hello-world.
	- I was unable to run backup.sh.
- Variables:
	- was able to execute welcome.sh properly.
	- was unable to execute backup.sh properly.
- Functions were executed properly, except for backup.sh.
- Numeric and String Comparisons were executed properly.
- Conditional Statements were executed properly, except for backup.sh.
- Positional Parameters were executed properly, but backup.sh came back as a failed backup.
